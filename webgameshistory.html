                            <p> Later in the 1960s, computers started to offer time-sharing, allowing numerous users to share a computer at the same time. Computer terminal systems were developed, allowing users to operate the computer from a room other than
                                the one in which it was kept. Soon after, modem links extended this range even further, allowing users to connect to their host computers via dial-up or leased telephone lines without having to be in the same building as
                                the computer. As remote access became more common, "host-based" games were developed, in which users on remote computers linked to a central computer to play single-player and, later, multiplayer games.</p>

                                received network packets; systems located across LANs or the Internet could play games in peer-to-peer or clientâ€“server modes.</p>
